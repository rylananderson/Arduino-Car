# Arduino Car

## Overview
Goal: The objective of this task is to build a car using Arduino parts that can be controlled remotely.
The car should be able to move in all directions and respond accordingly to instructions wirelessly sent.
In the process of doing this, I want to gain a better understanding of how embedded processing works. 
Solving this problem will also strengthen my C++ skills in this area of study.

## Parts
1 Arduino Uno, Motor Driver Shield, 4 wheels, 4 TT Gear motors, 2 18650 LI-ON Batteries, 1 battery holder,
ribbon cable male to female wires, HC-05 Bluetooth module and 1 wood 10” X 6.5” platform.

## Installation
This project requires four major components that will be laid out here: Arduino IDE, Adafruit Motor Shield library, Bluetooth RC Car App,
and all the physical parts necessary to put together the car. The code can be run on any Arduino IDE that has the Adafruit Motor Shield library
(version 1.0.1) installed. Once the code is downloaded, make sure you specify which board you are using, in this case, Arduino Uno. Next, the Serial
Port will have to be selected. For this project I used COM3, but this is modifiable and can be changed if necessary. To control the car, you will need
to download the Bluetooth RC Car App, a link to downloading it can be found below. Build the project and upload the code to your car and you will be able
to control your Arduino car through the app on your phone.
